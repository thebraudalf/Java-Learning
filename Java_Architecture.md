# Java Architecture

             
 ## JDK
- It provides an environment to develop and run the Java program
- It is a package that includes : <br>
             1. Development tools - to provide an environment to develop your program. <br>
             2. JRE - to execute your program. <br> 
             3. a compiler - javac  <br>
             4. archiver - jar   <br>
             5. doc generator - javadoc  <br>
             6. interpreter / loader    <br>
  

## JRE 
- It is an installation package that provides environment to only run the program
- It consists of : <br>
          1. Deployment Technologies  <br>
          2. User interface toolkits   <br>
          3. Integration Libraries    <br>
          4. Base Libraries           <br>
          5. JVM                      <br>
- After we get .class file, the next things happen in runtime <br>
    1. class loader loads all classes need to execute the program.
    2. JVM sends code to byte code verifier to check the format of code.
