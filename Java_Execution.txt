  this is the source code              - this code will not directly
                                         run on a system.
                                       - we need JVM to run this
                                       - This is the reason why Java
                                         Platform independent.


More about Platform independence
- It means byte code can run on all operating systems
- We need to convert source code to machine code so computer can understand
- Compiler helps in doing this by turning it into executable code
- this executable code is a set of instructions for the computer
- After compiling C/C++ code we get .exe file which is platform dependent
- In Java we have byte code JVM converts this to machine code
- Java is platform independent but JVM is platform dependent
